# Arduino Clone
This project involves creating a microcontroller similar to the Arduino UNO. The design and implementation were based on the guidance provided by the Fedevel Academy. The project includes PCB layout design using Altium Designer, soldering the components, checking the soldered connections, programming, and testing the microcontroller.

## Designing PCB layout and 3D model in Altium Designer

Designing the PCB layout and 3D model in Altium Designer. I have uploaded all the necessary documents for circuit manufacturing to the repository. For guidance on creating the schematic and PCB layout, I followed Robert Feranec's videos.

After designing the PCB layout, I had the board manufactured by JLCPCB.

After soldering all the components, I checked each soldered connection using a multimeter to ensure that all connections were properly made. Afterward, I soldered the connectors and checked them as well to ensure proper connections. Fortunately, all the soldered joints were correct, so no further adjustments were needed.
