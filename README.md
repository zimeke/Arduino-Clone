# Arduino Clone
This project involves creating a microcontroller similar to the Arduino UNO. The design and implementation were based on the guidance provided by the Robert Feranec. The project includes PCB layout design using Altium Designer, soldering the components, checking the soldered connections, programming, and testing the microcontroller.

## Designing PCB layout and 3D model in Altium Designer

I developed the PCB layout design and the board's 3D model using Altium Designer. All necessary documents for circuit manufacturing have been uploaded to the repository. For guidance on creating the schematic and PCB layout, I followed Robert Feranec's instructional videos.

After designing the PCB layout, I had the board manufactured by JLCPCB. I ordered the components from Digi-Key, which I soldered onto the PCB by hand. For the soldering process, I utsed the following tools:
* Flux: EDSYN FL 22 R & Stannol 165018 F-SW 26
* Solder: STANNOL HF32
* Tweezers
* Soldering Station: Hakko FX888D
* Soldering Tip: Hakko T18-D24
* Desoldering Wire

After soldering all the components, I checked each soldered connection using a multimeter to ensure that all connections were properly made. Afterward, I soldered the connectors and checked them as well to ensure proper connections. Fortunately, all the soldered joints were correct, so no further adjustments were needed.
